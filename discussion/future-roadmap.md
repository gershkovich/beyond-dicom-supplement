# Future Roadmap

This document outlines a vision for the evolution of modular imaging approaches and interoperability in digital pathology, extending the ideas presented in "Wearing a Fur Coat in the Summertime: Should Digital Pathology Redefine Medical Imaging?"

## Near-Term Goals (1-2 Years)

1. **Reference Implementations**: Development of open-source reference implementations demonstrating modular pathology data handling

2. **Interchange Profiles**: Definition of standard interchange profiles for common digital pathology workflows

3. **Validation Tools**: Creation of validation suites to verify conformance to modular interchange standards

## Medium-Term Vision (3-5 Years)

1. **Cross-Platform Integration**: Seamless integration between pathology, radiology, and other clinical data systems using modular standards

2. **Vendor Ecosystem**: Growth of vendor solutions supporting modular approaches with clear interoperability

3. **AI Framework Integration**: Standard interfaces for AI model integration with modular pathology data

## Long-Term Possibilities (5+ Years)

1. **Unified Clinical Imaging**: Evolution toward unified imaging standards across medical disciplines based on modular principles

2. **Open Data Networks**: Secure networks for anonymized clinical imaging data sharing using modular formats

3. **Distributed Analysis**: Standardized approaches for distributed analysis of pathology data across institutions

## Challenges to Address

1. **Data Provenance**: Maintaining clear data provenance across modular components
2. **Backwards Compatibility**: Ensuring continued support for older systems during transition periods
3. **Education & Training**: Developing educational resources for implementation and best practices

This roadmap will evolve based on community input and technological developments in the field.
