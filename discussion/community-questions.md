# Community Questions

This document poses questions for peer engagement and review regarding the ideas presented in "Wearing a Fur Coat in the Summertime: Should Digital Pathology Redefine Medical Imaging?"

## Implementation Considerations

1. **Practical Transitions**: What transition paths would be most feasible for institutions with existing DICOM-based workflows?

2. **Legacy Integration**: How can modular approaches best interface with legacy DICOM systems during transition periods?

3. **Vendor Support**: What incentives would drive vendor adoption of modular standards over extending their DICOM implementations?

## Technical Questions

1. **Performance Concerns**: Does the proposed modular approach introduce performance penalties compared to monolithic file formats?

2. **Security Implications**: How do the security models differ between traditional DICOM and the proposed modular approach?

3. **Validation Standards**: What validation and conformance processes would be needed for modular implementations?

## Research & Clinical Impact

1. **Research Workflows**: How might modular approaches accelerate computational pathology research?

2. **Clinical Integration**: What challenges might arise when integrating modular pathology data into clinical workflows?

3. **Regulatory Considerations**: How would modular approaches be evaluated by regulatory bodies compared to DICOM-based solutions?
