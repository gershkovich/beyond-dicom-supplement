**technical specification** for setting up your GitHub-based supplement to *“Wearing a Fur Coat in the Summertime”*. This specification assumes the repository will serve as a **structured, modular, interactive supplement** to the paper—supporting reuse, transparency, and engagement with readers and researchers.

## 📄 README.md Specification

This file will serve as a **narrative and index** to the repository.

### Required Sections

1. **Project Title and Purpose**

   * Clearly state this is a supplement to the academic paper.
   * Mention goals: transparency, community feedback, reusable examples, etc.

2. **Link to the Paper**

   * Include DOI or preprint URL.

3. **Repository Goals**

   * Explain the principles behind the repo (modularity, standards, transparency).

4. **Directory Guide**

   * One-paragraph description per directory.
   * e.g., `"figures/ contains all visual materials used in the paper, provided in both high-resolution and editable formats (SVG, PDF)"`

5. **Using the Utilities**

   * Describe how to run scripts, generate visuals, etc.

6. **Discussion Participation**

   * How to engage: Issues tab, `discussion/` proposals, GitHub Discussions if enabled.

7. **Citing This Repository**

   * How to cite the GitHub repo (Zenodo DOI if you archive a release).

8. **Licensing**

   * State license (e.g., MIT for code, CC BY 4.0 for figures).

9. **Contributing**

   * Guidelines for opening issues or submitting pull requests.

10. **Contact**

    * Email or form of contact for scholarly discussion or collaboration.

## 🧪 AI Code Generation Tasks

This section defines tasks for a future AI agent or script to automate content generation.

### 1. **Generate Figures**

* Scripts to:

  * Convert raw data into visual diagrams.
  * Generate DICOM vs Modular architecture diagrams.
  * Visualize NIST overlay stack, modular pipelines, etc.
* Output to `figures/`.

### 2. **Generate Tables**

* Pull or simulate breach data (e.g., from OCR public sources).
* Format DICOM conformance tables or security overlay mappings.
* Output CSV and Markdown versions to `tables/`.

### 3. **Create and Populate `examples/`**

* Export:

  * Sample HL7 FHIR JSON for image metadata.
  * SVG/GeoJSON annotations (e.g., a tumor region on a 2D canvas).
  * OME-TIFF metadata YAML/XML.
* All artificial or de-identified.

### 4. **Discussion Organization**

`discussion/` should serve as a **narrative workspace** with Markdown topics.

* `000_index.md`: Introduction and outline of discussion categories.
* `design-choices.md`: Justification of architecture, format, and standard choices.
* `community-questions.md`: Prompted questions for peer engagement or review.
* `future-roadmap.md`: Vision for modular imaging and evolving interoperability.

Each file is:

* Written in Markdown for GitHub-native readability.
* Designed for **iteration**, **commenting**, and **version control**.

### 5. **Utilities Framework**

Python utilities should:

* Be modular and comment-rich.
* Include:

  * `generate_figure1.py`: architecture diagrams.
  * `convert_csv_to_md.py`: for table rendering.
  * `generate_overlay_example.py`: mock PHI masking on WSI regions.
* Use standard Python packages (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `json`, `pydicom`, `PIL`).

Would you like me to generate a starter `README.md`, sample `discussion/000_index.md`, or the Python utility framework outline next?
